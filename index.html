   <h2>About this course</h2>
    <p> 
      Part 1 of this course is an introduction to the basic concepts, organization, and
      implementation models of databases, with an emphasis on the relational model. Among the
      topics covered are the development of simple queries that retrieve and mutate the data in a 
      database. Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL that is used by database
      developers to create, maintain, and query facts in the database. Students gain a thorough 
      understanding of the DML syntax and the options available when retrieving facts back from
      the database. Database development and administration skills are required in most Information
      Technology, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science jobs.
      this part utilizes the open-source relational database MySQL. MySQL and it's open source 
      fork MariaDB are used in millions of web apps to persist the application data and provide
      query processing. The applied SQL labs expand on the classroom lectures to provide students
      with hands-on experience with a relational database management system (RDBMS) and structured
      query language (SQL).
    </p>
    <P>
     Part 2 of this  course is a continuation of the basic concepts, organization, and
      implementation models t, with an emphasis on the relational model. Among the topics
      covered are the development of advanced queries that utilize aggregation, subqueries and
      built-in functions. Aggregation queries are used to pull back summary data to help
      understand the detailed instances in the database. Subqueries help to break large into 
      smaller testable component parts. Functions are used to format and perform calculations on 
      the data returned in the query. Database development and administration skills are required 
      in most Information Technology, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science jobs.
      This part utilizes the open-source relational database MySQL. MySQL and it's open-source fork 
      MariaDB are used in millions of web apps to persist the application data and provide query 
      processing. Applied labs expand on the lectures to provide students with hands-on experience with
       a relational database management system (DBMS) and structured query language (SQL).

     Part 3 of this course is a continuation of the part 1 and part 2 , the topics covered are the 
     development of objects in the database such as databases, tables, indexes, views, stored procedures
     and functions. Data Definition Language (DDL) is a subset of SQL that is used by database 
     administrators to create and maintain these objects in the database. Students gain a thorough 
     understanding of the DDL syntax and the use cases for each object type. Database development and 
     administration skills are required in most Information Technology, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, 
     and Computer Science jobs. The course utilizes the open-source relational database MySQL. MySQL and 
     it's open-source fork MariaDB are used in millions of web apps to persist the application data and provide
